svaaaps is not really a part of this anymore 
site is live @ https://lumin0sity-dev.github.io/1.12-eaglercraftx/
you can dupe this link (make a new link to escape blocking) by
1. press the fork button up top.
2. make your repo name.
3. use copilot to generate a new link (<your github username here>.github.io)
4. if it doesn't work, try making a custom domain.
if these steps dont work, then i'm dumb & you should use copilot
